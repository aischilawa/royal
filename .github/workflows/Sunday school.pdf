Luke 1:28-38
[28]The angel came to her and said, “Peace be with you! The Lord is with you and has greatly blessed you!”
[29]Mary was deeply troubled by the angel's message, and she wondered what his words meant.
[30]The angel said to her, “Don't be afraid, Mary; God has been gracious to you.
[31]You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.
[32]He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High God. The Lord God will make him a king, as his ancestor David was,
[33]and he will be the king of the descendants of Jacob for ever; his kingdom will never end!”
[34]Mary said to the angel, “I am a virgin. How, then, can this be?”
[35]The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and God's power will rest upon you. For this reason the holy child will be called the Son of God.
[36]Remember your relative Elizabeth. It is said that she cannot have children, but she herself is now six months pregnant, even though she is very old.
[37]For there is nothing that God cannot do.”
[38]“I am the Lord's servant,” said Mary; “may it happen to me as you have said.” And the angel left her.



.Isaiah 9:6
[6]A child is born to us!     A son is given to us!     And he will be our ruler. He will be called, “Wonderful Counsellor”,     “Mighty God”, “Eternal Father”,     “Prince of Peace”.



Matthew 1:23
[23]“A virgin will become pregnant and have a son, and he will be called Immanuel” (which means, “God is with us”)


1 John 4:2
[2]This is how you will be able to know whether it is God's Spirit: anyone who acknowledges that Jesus Christ came as a human being has the Spirit who comes from God.
